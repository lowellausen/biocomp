# biocomp

Implementation of a few computational biology methods. 

* Lista 1: Identifying mutations; finding palindromes; identifying and counting different subsequeces of given size; more simple string treatment.
* Lista 2: Sequence allignment with Needleman-Wuschc, Smith-Waterman and with BLOSUM matrix.
* Lista 3: Forming a phylogenetic tree with UPGMA (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean) and Neihbour Joining methods.
* Lista 4: Clustering of microarray data with k-means and using genetics algorithm to optimize the selection of important genes for clustering.
* Lista 5: Finding common gene sequences (allowing mutations) in a set of different nucleotide sequences.
